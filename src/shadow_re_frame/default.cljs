;; 2. Event Handling
;;    register a handler for a given event.
;;
;;    - handlers are identified by keyword.
;;    - simple method:   `reg-event-db` is passed `db` as 1st argument.
;;      advanced method: `reg-event-fx` is passed 'co-effects' map as 1st argument of which `:db` is one key.

(rf/reg-event-db :inc-counter
                 (fn [db [_ counter-id]]
                   (update-in db [::counters counter-id] inc)))


(rf/reg-event-db :initialize
                 ;; we'll call this once, at the beginning, to set up the db.
                 (constantly {::counters {"A" 0
                                          "B" 0
                                          "C" 0}}))

;; 3. Queries
;;    make a query for every kind of 'read' into the db.
;;
;;    - queries are identified by keyword.
;;    - queries can (optionally) take parameters.
;;    - `db` is passed as 1st arg to function.
;;      vector of [query-id & args] is passed as 2nd arg.

(rf/reg-sub ::counter
            (fn [db [_ counter-id]]
              (get-in db [::counters counter-id])))

            (fn [db _]
              (-> (get db ::counters)
                  (keys))))

;; 4. Views
;;    Use reagent to create views.
;;
;;    - use `re-frame.core/subscribe` to read queries
;;    - use `reagent/atom` for local state (not shown here)
